CSS to modify the discordapp

*Most of the stuff have customizable variables. Reminder to change them as needed.*
  - `bg-set.css` is for setting the background
    - Structured from back to front. Elements in back typically have larger sizes.
    - All elements can have custom background, including transparency. Can be used to overlay/filter.
    - Background image URLs can only be pulled from discord.com ([⚠️ Discord is making cdn links temporary](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/discord-will-switch-to-temporary-file-links-to-block-malware-delivery/))
